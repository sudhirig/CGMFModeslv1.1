## Complete Schema Structure

### Core Identification Fields

| `score_date` | date | NO | Date of score calculation | System generated (CURRENT_DATE) |
| `created_at` | timestamp | YES | Record creation timestamp | System default (now()) |

### Historical Returns Components (40 points maximum)

| Field | Type | Range | Calculation Logic | Data Source |
|-------|------|-------|-------------------|-------------|
| `return_3m_score` | numeric | -0.30 to 8.00 | Based on 3-month annualized returns from authentic NAV data. Score thresholds: ≥15% = 8pts, ≥12% = 6.4pts, ≥8% = 4.8pts, ≥5% = 3.2pts, ≥0% = 1.6pts | nav_data table (90-day period) |
| `return_6m_score` | numeric | -0.40 to 8.00 | Based on 6-month annualized returns. Same scoring thresholds as 3M | nav_data table (180-day period) |
| `return_1y_score` | numeric | -0.20 to 5.90 | Based on 1-year returns. Performance calculated from NAV data 365 days apart | nav_data table (365-day period) |
| `return_3y_score` | numeric | -0.10 to 8.00 | Based on 3-year annualized returns. Calculated from NAV data 1095 days apart | nav_data table (3-year period) |
| `return_5y_score` | numeric | 0.00 to 8.00 | Based on 5-year annualized returns. Calculated from NAV data 1825 days apart | nav_data table (5-year period) |

**Calculation Formula for Returns:**
```
Annualized Return = ((Latest NAV / Historical NAV) ^ (365 / Days Between)) - 1
Score = Based on performance thresholds (0-8 points per period)
```

2. **funds table**: Fund master data (inception date, expense ratio, AUM)
3. **market_indices table**: Benchmark data for beta/correlation calculations

### Calculation Sequence
1. **Raw Metrics Calculation**: Volatility, returns, drawdowns from NAV data
2. **Individual Component Scoring**: Convert raw metrics to 0-8 point scores
3. **Component Totals**: Sum individual scores into category totals
4. **Total Score**: Sum all category totals (max 100 points)
5. **Ranking and Quartiles**: Rank all funds and assign quartiles
6. **Recommendations**: Apply multi-factor logic to assign investment recommendations

### Data Quality Requirements
- Minimum 252 NAV records (approximately 1 year) for scoring eligibility
- Recent NAV data (created after 2025-05-30 06:45:00) ensures authenticity
- All calculations use genuine market data - no synthetic or placeholder values
