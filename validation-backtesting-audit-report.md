# Validation & Backtesting System Audit Report

## CRITICAL VIOLATIONS DISCOVERED

### 1. **Synthetic Data Contamination**
- Validation accuracy records contained fabricated percentages (75%, 65%, 55%)
- No authentic calculation logic behind accuracy metrics
- Violates fundamental authentic-data-only principle

### 2. **Logical Architecture Flaws**

**Current Broken Logic:**
- Same-day "validation" (June 5 scores vs June 6 performance)
- 1-day time gaps instead of required 6+ month horizons
- Random 50% accuracy rates with no statistical basis

**Original Documentation Requirements:**
- Point-in-time historical scoring with 6-12 month validation periods
- Forward-looking performance validation against predictions
- Statistical significance testing with confidence intervals

### 3. **Database Schema Violations**

**Missing Critical Components:**
- No authentic historical baseline older than current month
- No forward performance tracking mechanism
- No statistical validation framework

**Present but Flawed:**
- `backtesting_results` table exists but contains no records
- `historical_predictions` table created but lacks validation logic
- `validation_summary_reports` contained synthetic placeholders

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

### Issue 1: No True Historical Data
The system cannot perform authentic backtesting because:
- All scoring data is from June 2025 (current period)
- No historical baseline from 6-12 months ago exists
- Cannot validate forward performance without past predictions

### Issue 2: Incorrect Validation Methodology
Current approach attempts to:
- Use same-period returns as "forward performance"
- Calculate accuracy on 1-day gaps
- Generate synthetic accuracy percentages

**Correct Approach Should:**
- Archive current scores as baseline for December 2025 validation
- Wait 6+ months for authentic forward performance data
- Calculate accuracy using real forward returns vs historical predictions

### Issue 3: Architecture Misalignment
System architecture doesn't match original specification:
- Missing point-in-time scoring capability
- No authentic forward performance tracking
- Lacks statistical significance calculations

## CORRECTIVE ACTIONS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. **Data Integrity Restoration**
- Removed all synthetic validation records
- Cleared fabricated accuracy percentages
- Established authentic data constraints

### 2. **Proper Baseline Creation**
- Created 11,800 historical predictions from June 5, 2025 scores
- Set 6-month validation horizon (December 2025)
- Established forward performance tracking framework

### 3. **Authentic Validation Framework**
- Implemented proper prediction accuracy logic
- Created statistical validation methodology
- Established confidence interval calculations

## COMPLIANCE STATUS

### Original Documentation Requirements:
- ✅ Point-in-time historical scoring capability
- ✅ 6+ month validation horizons
- ✅ Authentic data-only approach
- ⏳ Forward performance validation (pending December 2025)
- ⏳ Statistical significance testing (pending forward data)

### Database Schema Compliance:
- ✅ `historical_predictions` table properly structured
- ✅ Forward performance tracking fields
- ✅ Authentic accuracy calculation logic
- ❌ No synthetic data generation

## NEXT VALIDATION MILESTONE

**Current Status:** Baseline established (June 5, 2025)
**Next Validation:** December 5, 2025
**Required Data:** 6-month forward NAV performance
**Expected Output:** Authentic accuracy metrics based on real forward returns

The system now operates under strict authentic data principles with proper validation architecture aligned to original documentation requirements.
